<h1>Assault and retreat</h1>
<div class="block clearfix">
<div class="block-main">
<h2>Singapore Island</h2>
<p>On 8 February, just one month after the initial Japanese attack into northern Malaya, the Japanese assaulted Singapore Island. On 15 February, after an uncoordinated defence, Singapore surrendered. In just 70 days, three Japanese divisions had defeated a field force of comparable size and taken 130,000 Allied prisoners.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Retreat from Burma</h2>
<p>The British humiliation in the Far East was over, but even before the fall of Singapore, the Japanese had turned their attention to Burma. The dismal story of British and Imperial military failure in Malaya was repeated. On 7 March <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-r.htm#Rangoon" title="Glossary term - Rangoon">Rangoon</a></span> was evacuated and the remaining British forces in Burma began a long retreat through roadless jungle to India. In mid May 1942 the rearguard crossed into <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/glossary.htm#Assam" title="Glossary term - Assam">Assam</a></span>. The retreat was over.</p>
<p>At sea, in April 1942 a raid by a large Japanese aircraft carrier force prompted the Royal Navy to move back from <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-c.htm#Ceylon" title="Glossary term - Ceylon">Ceylon</a></span> to the east coast of Africa, losing an aircraft carrier in the process. The Eastern Fleet that was being built up to replace the destroyed Force Z was too old and weak to contest control of the eastern Indian Ocean with a vigorous and highly efficient Imperial Japanese Navy.</p>
<h2>American offensive</h2>
<p>The summer of 1942 was the high water point of Japanese advances in the Far East.&nbsp; At <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-m.htm#Midway" title="Glossary term - Midway">Midway</a></span> the Japanese navy suffered a serious defeat and the American offensive began in the Solomon Islands - the start of an island-hopping campaign that would carry them to within striking distance of the Japanese home islands.</p>
<h2>Scarce resources for British Army</h2>
<p>For the British, after the humiliation of Malaya, the destruction of the Navy&#39;s Force Z, and the retreat from Burma, all chances for a counter attack rested with the Army in India. The Royal Navy&#39;s new Eastern fleet was far too weak to attack the Japanese Navy and had no amphibious shipping to launch a seaborne invasion, severely limiting options. Resources for an attack by the army in India were scarce. Furthermore, operations could only be undertaken in the dry season - from about May through to November each year the monsoon made large-scale movement all but impossible. Despite these setbacks, 1943 would see the first British counter-offensive.</p>
