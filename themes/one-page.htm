<h1>Link between smoking and cancer</h1>
<div class="block clearfix">
<div class="block-main">
<p>During the late 1940s, an epidemiological study was conducted on the correlation between smoking and lung cancer. In 1950, the results were published in the British Medical Journal, which indicated a definite link and confirmed a similar study in the US. In 1951, following campaigning by the Medical Director of the Central Medical Hospital, <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-h.htm#Horace_Joules_Dr" title="Glossary term - Dr Horace Joules">Dr Horace Joules</a></span>, the <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-s.htm#Standing_Advisory_Committee" title="Glossary term - Standing Advisory Committee">Standing Advisory Committee</a></span> on Cancer &amp; Radiotherapy (SACCR) informed the Minister of Health of a statistical link between smoking and cancer. By the end of 1953, the SACCR was arguing there was a real association, and recommended that the young should be warned against the dangers of smoking.</p>
<p>The matter first came before Cabinet in 1954. The Minister of Health, <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-i.htm#Iain_MacLeod" title="Glossary term - Iain MacLeod">Iain MacLeod</a></span>, who was convinced of an association between smoking and lung cancer, recommended the release of a public statement on the matter. Cabinet decided to allow a &pound;250,000 grant from the tobacco industry to the <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-m.htm#Medical_Research_Council" title="Glossary term - Medical Research Council">Medical Research Council</a></span> (MRC) to go through. <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-i.htm#Iain_MacLeod" title="Glossary term - Iain MacLeod">Iain MacLeod</a></span> and the MRC officials attended a press conference on 12 February, warning of the dangers of &#39;excessive&#39; smoking.</p>
<h2>Public awareness</h2>
<p>There was much public interest in the Minister&#39;s statement, and further evidence against smoking was accumulated over the following two years. The Standing Medical Advisory Committee (SMAC) pressed for a &#39;propaganda&#39; campaign to alert the public to the danger of smoking. The government, however, was mindful that tobacco taxes contributed over &pound;600 million per annum to revenue in the early 1950s, more than expenditure on the health service. Following the advice of SMAC, Cabinet appointed a Committee of Ministers to consider the question. Cabinet decided to put the relevant details before the public, without making any further commitment.</p>
<p>Following a further report, the <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-m.htm#Medical_Research_Council" title="Glossary term - Medical Research Council">Medical Research Council</a></span> (MRC), who had been until now sceptical, accepted a relationship of cause and effect between smoking and cancer. Cabinet ordered the publication of the MRC report and a press release, but refused to admit any &#39;duty&#39; to go further than making the information available. The press release was amended to shift the emphasis to heavy smoking.</p>
<p>Over the next five years, medical officials drew attention to increased spending by the tobacco industry on advertising that targeted the young. The government remained unwilling to initiate a public health campaign, but a report by the Royal College of Physicians, published in 1962, increased the pressure.</p>
<h2>Campaign of Government publicity</h2>
<p>Cabinet now considered the &#39;new departure&#39; of a more active policy, including a campaign to publicise the dangers of smoking and restrictions on tobacco advertising and tax increases. It was noted, however, that tobacco taxes contributed over &pound;800 milllion per annum to the Exchequer and Cabinet. Eventually, Cabinet agreed to a &#39;modest campaign of Government publicity&#39;. In 1965, the Labour Cabinet decided to prohibit cigarette advertising on television and to expand the existing public health campaign.</p>
