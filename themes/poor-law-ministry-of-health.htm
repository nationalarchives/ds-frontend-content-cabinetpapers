<h1>The Poor Law and Ministry of Health</h1>
<div class="block clearfix">
<div class="block-main">
<h2>The Poor Law</h2>
<p>By the 1910s, public health services were provided through an unevenly distributed and decentralised system of charitable voluntary hospitals, workhouses and hospitals, administered under the <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-p.htm#Poor_Law" title="Glossary term - Poor Law">Poor Law</a></span> through the <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-l.htm#Local_Government_Board" title="Glossary term - Local Government Board">Local Government Board</a></span>. The board was also responsible for sanitation and environmental health. The majority of wage earners received medical care from general practitioners who were paid a capitation fee per patient treated. This was funded by worker contributions to &#39;approved&#39; societies, which could be insurance companies, friendly societies, trade unions or other associations.</p>
<p>In 1917, <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-c.htm#Christopher_Addison" title="Glossary term - Christopher Addison">Christopher Addison</a></span>, the Minister of Munitions (and later Reconstruction), and <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-r.htm#Rhondda_Lord" title="Glossary term - Lord Rhondda">Lord Rhondda</a></span>, President of the Local Government Board, were in favour of removing the health function from the Board and <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-p.htm#Poor_Law" title="Glossary term - Poor Law">Poor Law</a></span> administration. Rhondda introduced his ideas about a Ministry of Health to Cabinet in April 1917, and later produced a draft Ministry of Health Bill.</p>
<h2>Ministry of Health Act 1919</h2>
<p>The question of transferring <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-p.htm#Poor_Law" title="Glossary term - Poor Law">Poor Law</a></span> health functions to the new ministry was politically controversial. Following the replacement of <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-r.htm#Rhondda_Lord" title="Glossary term - Lord Rhondda">Lord Rhondda</a></span> by <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-h.htm#HAL_Fisher" title="Glossary term - H.A.L Fisher">H.A.L Fisher</a></span>, members of the <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-l.htm#Local_Government_Board" title="Glossary term - Local Government Board">Local Government Board</a></span> resisted the establishment of a Ministry of Health because they feared the break up of the <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-p.htm#Poor_Law" title="Glossary term - Poor Law">Poor Law</a></span> administration if the health function was removed. The Ministry of Health Act of 1919 was a compromise. The Ministry of Health took over the functions of the <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-l.htm#Local_Government_Board" title="Glossary term - Local Government Board">Local Government Board</a></span> and National Health Insurance administration. If the <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-p.htm#Poor_Law" title="Glossary term - Poor Law">Poor Law</a></span> was revised later, its non-health functions would be removed from the Ministry.</p>
<h2>Recommendations for health service provision</h2>
<p>The inheritance of varied <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-l.htm#Local_Government_Board" title="Glossary term - Local Government Board">Local Government Board</a></span> duties meant that the ministry devoted a limited time to health service administration. Nevertheless, the Dawson Interim Report on the Future Provision of Medical and Allied Services of 1920 provided a blueprint for a comprehensive and free national health service. It recommended a wide range of services, including domiciliary services, primary health centres, secondary health centres for specialist diagnosis and treatment, teaching hospitals and research, and the transfer of all services to a unitary authority.</p>
<h2>Hospital funding</h2>
<p>Although the poor state of hospitals required immediate action, little was achieved during the inter-war years. The Cave Committee of 1921 made provision for public funding of hospitals, but only on a temporary basis because it might undermine the charitable funding of voluntary hospitals. Further reform was achieved through <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-n.htm#Neville_Chamberlain" title="Glossary term - Neville Chamberlain">Neville Chamberlain</a></span>&#39;s Local Government Act of 1929, which transferred the responsibilities of the <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-p.htm#Poor_Law_Board_of_Guardians" title="Glossary term - Poor Law Board of Guardians">Poor Law Board of Guardians</a></span> to local authorities, enabling them to provide hospital and health services.</p>
<p>In 1939, fearing many casualties from bombing, the government established the Emergency Medical Service to coordinate treatment. The Ministry of Health was now able to direct voluntary and local authority hospitals.<br /></p>
