<h1>The EEC and Britain&#39;s late entry</h1>
<div class="block clearfix">

<h2>Early moves towards integration in Europe</h2>
<p>Britain, along with 17 other countries, was a founding member of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (OEEC), established in 1948. The OEEC administered Marshall Aid and worked towards the reduction of trade restrictions between members. The Council of Europe was then established in 1949, shortly after the formation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) with its larger membership that included the US and Canada.</p>
<p>In June 1950, Britain reacted negatively to Robert Schuman’s proposal to establish a supranational body to regulate the production and sale of coal and steel: a plan that was realised with the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), established in 1952, with Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and West Germany as the founding members. The British Government was invited to participate in the ECSC, but declined to do so, though it joined as an Associate Member in 1954.</p>
<p>In 1955, The British government did not send a representative to the Messina Conference of the six ECSC members, and although Britain did send a senior official, Russell Bretherton from the Board of Trade to the Spaak Committee (which resulted from the Messina Conference), he was withdrawn by the end of 1955. The 'Inner Six' (France, Italy, West Germany, and the three Benelux countries: Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands) signed the Treaty of Rome in March 1957, establishing the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom). The EEC began work in 1958. The British had suggested a free trade area around the proposed customs union of the EEC, but this was rejected in 1958, for it was viewed as competition for the new EEC.</p>
<p>In 1959 Britain signed the Stockholm Convention with other non-EEC European states (Austria, Denmark, Norway, Portugal, Sweden and Switzerland) which established the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) in 1960. However, EFTA  was no competitor for the EEC. It was also clear that no country could be a member of EFTA as well, if it joined the EEC</p>
<p>In 1961 the OEEC was replaced by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which extended membership to non-European states, the first of which were the United States and Canada.</p>

<h2>Britain applies to join the EEC</h2>
<p>The Conservative Party Prime Minister, Harold Macmillan, noted the rapid economic advances made by France and West Germany in comparison to Britain’s sluggish economic performance. This concern, coupled with the desire to uphold Britain’s status and prestige as a world power, explain Macmillan’s decision to apply to join the EEC.</p>
<p>Britain's Commonwealth ties, agricultural arrangements, and close links to the US were obstacles in joining and the French President, Charles de Gaulle, vetoed Britain's application in 1963, as he was entitled to do under the terms of the Rome Treaty. The Labour government Prime Minister, Harold Wilson again failed to take Britain into the EEC in 1967 as he encountered (what amounted to) a second veto by de Gaulle. Georges Pompidou, who succeeded de Gaulle, finally relented and Britain joined in January 1973 under the premiership of Conservative Prime Minister, Edward Heath.</p>
<p>The 1974 Wilson government was unhappy with the terms of EEC membership and held a referendum in June 1975. A substantial majority voted in favour of continued membership.</p>
