maps in time readme file

Original flash (.fla) files have been left in position alongside the swf files, but will not need copying to the server. 

Help files are included as word documents in the "help files" folder. These provide advice on how to add and edit hotspots and resource pop ups. However please note the interactive is complicated and intricate, and edits should only be undertaken by those with a thorough understanding of Flash and actionscript.

All the swf files and the maps-in-time.htm file are new and should replace those currently live. Please note there is also a new "audio" folder that should be uploaded.

The "resource-downloads" folder and its contents have not changed.

Every effort has been made to ensure that the final amends and additions have not had unwanted knock-on effects, but we recommend the new interactive should be tested at National Archives before going live.

We recommend a back up copy of these files be made immediately. Due to the complex nature of the interactive it is also advisable to make a back up if any files are edited, so that it is possible to revert to the previous state should any bugs appear as a result of editing. 

By default publishing from Flash will automatically generate html files with a .html suffix, at the same time as the swf files being published. It will also automatically create a javascript file that is named in a way incompatible with your cms. Therefore if any files are republished only use the new swf file that is generated, ignore any new html or js files. The only html file needed is maps-in-time.htm as in this folder and the only javascript file needed is ac-runactivecontent.js.
