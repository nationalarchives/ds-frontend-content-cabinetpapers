<h1>Kemal&#39;s nationalists and the collapse of government</h1>
<div class="block clearfix">
<div class="block-main">
<h2>Kemal&#39;s nationalist movement</h2>
<p>At the end of the war with Turkey the British Cabinet (<span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-c.htm#Curzon_Lord" title="Glossary term - Lord Curzon">Lord Curzon</a></span> in particular) wanted to ensure that Turkey could never threaten British interests again. Initially it was suggested that the Ottoman Empire be completely broken up and the Turks expelled from European Turkey (including <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-c.htm#Constantinople" title="Glossary term - Constantinople">Constantinople</a></span>) to safeguard the <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-d.htm#Dardanelles" title="Glossary term - Dardanelles">Dardanelles</a></span>. The Empire was also to be stripped of possessions in Armenia and the Arab lands. As the treaty negotiations began in January 1920, the Cabinet modified this programme and made the demilitarisation and internationalisation of the straits a central element of the peace terms.</p>
<p>By the mid 1920s, however, the Ottoman administration based in <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-c.htm#Constantinople" title="Glossary term - Constantinople">Constantinople</a></span> was being rapidly replaced by <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-m.htm#Mustafa_Kemal" title="Glossary term - Mustafa Kemal">Mustafa Kemal</a></span>&#39;s nationalist movement based in <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/glossary.htm#Ankara" title="Glossary term - Ankara">Ankara</a></span>. In June 1920 before the <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-t.htm#Treaty_of_Sevres" title="Glossary term - Treaty of Sevres">Treaty of Sevres</a></span> could be signed, Turkish resistance to its terms had increased Kemal&#39;s supporters (including those in <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-c.htm#Constantinople" title="Glossary term - Constantinople">Constantinople</a></span>), and his forces advanced on the practically undefended straits.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Greek-Turkish war</h2>
<p>The Cabinet was determined to defend the straits, despite the lack of British forces to send. Instead, the Greeks were co-opted, with the understanding that the Greek enclave of <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-s.htm#Smyrna" title="Glossary term - Smyrna">Smyrna</a></span> would be enlarged if they helped to destroy Turkish nationalism. In 1921 the unpredictable nature of the Greek-Turkish war and the view that the Greeks were often close to victory helped Lloyd George and Curzon defend the government&#39;s policy from within the Cabinet.</p>
<p>By late 1921 the French and Italians were showing impatience with British policy in the region. In March 1922 Britain, France and Italy agreed on revised terms to be provisionally offered to the Ottoman authorities, and to Kemal. Yet again, the British insisted that the Turkish military must be kept away from the straits, although by smaller demilitarised zones than had been previously suggested.</p>
<h2>Defeat of the Greek forces</h2>
<p>Matters were brought to a head with the defeat of Greek forces in Asia Minor and the capture of <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-s.htm#Smyrna" title="Glossary term - Smyrna">Smyrna</a></span> by <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-k.htm#Kemalist" title="Glossary term - Kemalist">Kemalist</a></span> forces in August and September 1922. On the 7 September the Cabinet decided to defend the straits and <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-c.htm#Constantinople" title="Glossary term - Constantinople">Constantinople</a></span>. By 15 September both the Admiralty and the War Office had raised concerns about the practicalities of the policy, but the Cabinet remained adamant that the straits must not fall under Turkish military control. As Kemal&#39;s forces continued marching towards the straits, Cabinet consensus on defending <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-c.htm#Constantinople" title="Glossary term - Constantinople">Constantinople</a></span> started to collapse, and resulted in the decision not to hold the city.</p>
<p>Attention now centred on <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-c.htm#Chanak" title="Glossary term - Chanak">Chanak</a></span>. The British believed that <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-c.htm#Chanak" title="Glossary term - Chanak">Chanak</a></span> controlled the <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-d.htm#Dardanelles" title="Glossary term - Dardanelles">Dardanelles</a></span> (through which all reinforcements and supplies for the defence of <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-c.htm#Constantinople" title="Glossary term - Constantinople">Constantinople</a></span> passed) and that it would serve as an outpost for the defence of the <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-g.htm#Gallipoli_Peninsula" title="Glossary term - Gallipoli Peninsula">Gallipoli Peninsula</a></span> - the key to the whole straits. <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-c.htm#Chanak" title="Glossary term - Chanak">Chanak</a></span> therefore was given the highest priority for resources.</p>
<h2>Negotiation with Kemal</h2>
<p>On 29 September the Cabinet received a telegram from the Commander of the British garrison in <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-c.htm#Chanak" title="Glossary term - Chanak">Chanak</a></span>, <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-g.htm#General_Harrison" title="Glossary term - General Harrison">General Harrison</a></span>. It read that the <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-k.htm#Kemalist" title="Glossary term - Kemalist">Kemalist</a></span> forces had advanced right up to the defences. The Cabinet sent Harrison an ultimatum to be passed on to Kemal: withdraw or be fired upon. Harrison ignored the Cabinet&#39;s instructions and instead embarked on negotiation with Kemal; however, the negotiations broke down on 5 October.</p>
<p>After intense Cabinet discussion, it was decided that without the support of France or Italy, strict neutrality was the only course of action remaining.&nbsp;This neutrality involved withdrawal to <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-c.htm#Chanak" title="Glossary term - Chanak">Chanak</a></span> and Gallipoli, leaving the French and Italians without support in <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-c.htm#Constantinople" title="Glossary term - Constantinople">Constantinople</a></span>. The French pledged their support for an allied policy of refusing to admit the Turkish into the Eastern Thrace until a treaty had been signed. Four days later the Turks agreed to allied terms, and a stop to all military operations in the neutral straits zone.</p>
<h2>Collapse of government</h2>
<p>Events at <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-c.htm#Chanak" title="Glossary term - Chanak">Chanak</a></span> and the threat of war over the <span class="glossary"><a href="/cabinetpapers/help/glossary-d.htm#Dardanelles" title="Glossary term - Dardanelles">Dardanelles</a></span> greatly damaged Lloyd George&#39;s ability to control his coalition government and&nbsp;the end of the month Lloyd George&#39;s government had collapsed, paving the way for&nbsp;the Conservatives to take power.<br /></p>
